            <p>Education, as we understand it here, is a process of inviting truth and possibility, of encouraging and giving time to discovery. It is, as John Dewey (1916) put it, a social process – ‘a process of living and not a preparation for future living’. In this view educators look to learning and being with others rather than acting upon them. Their task is to educe (related to the Greek notion of educere), to bring out or develop potential both in themselves and others. Such education is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Delibrate and Hopeful</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Infrom, Respectful and Wise</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Grounded in a desire that at all may flourish and share in life</a></li>
            </ul>
